July 31 2019. Contact: <patlewicz.grace@epa.gov>, <nelms.mark@epa.gov>

This repository contains code and input files associated with the
manuscript of the same title that was published by Nelms et al (2019) in
… see … for more details.

In order to generate the files that are required to completely run this
project the files contained in the Code folder should be run in
numerical order (i.e. 00 -\> 03). All intermediate and output files can
be generated using the information present in the code and input data
folders.

Please note that R(v3.5.2), Toxtree (v3.1.0) and KNIME (v3.4.2) were
used throughout this project. Where you
see

``` r
####                                              ####                                            ####
##                                                                                                  ##
##                                                                                                  ##
####                                              ####                                            ####
```

indicates instances where external programs (Toxtree and/or KNIME) are
required to be used before continuing on with the R code.
